# @RaveReflections Twitter bot

The comments sections of dance tunes are probably the nicest place on YouTube; even if that is damning with faint praise. Comments are invariably kind, funny, nostalgic and even eutopian.

It's a nice part of the internet that I wanted to celebrate and promote to a wider audience and that's how I found myself building this bot.
