So many years have passed and yet I can still feel the love pulsating throughout the entire crowd... Dancing under the stars, we were just a tiny spec in the vast universe... Yet we were one... It's as if time stood still, and nothing else mattered...",

The light that shines the brightest burns half as long ..and he shone so very brightly",

My stereo system was hooked up in a way that I could record audio from the tv directly onto cassette tapes (which I utlized A LOT back then since there was no internet to find all the songs I liked but were never played on the radio). 2 years later one of my friends showed me that putting the game disc in your cd player gave you the soundtrack already, lol.",

There's an intense ball of anxiety that has made me an unstable mess, and I'm often stuck in my head in a painful place trying to reason my way out of it. But then I get in a room that's so loud and so peaceful and I realize everything's going to be just fine. And I'm amazed by the beauty I see in the eyes of people. People who have been in a hopeless dark place and are getting a glimpse of a safe place. It's a side of humanity that I didn't know existed, and it's a bit overwhelming.",
