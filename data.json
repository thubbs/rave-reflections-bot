I have no memory of her but I do have videos and pictures and that makes me happy. All my life i aimed to make my dad proud but at the same time I was so lost and scared of losing him that I never had the courage to talk to him about life after he’s gone... he also never got to see me graduate high school and that thought never went away either. I miss you dad. I hope you and mom are proud.",

If you were a raver back in the day then you know what I am about to say is true, IT WAS THE GREATEST TIME EVER ON THIS PLANET, 25 years later I'm  still dancing to this music to this day and listen to it. OH the memories, people don't get it 1997-2007 was the greatest decade ever. People were so loving and caring. TRANCE will live forever!!!!!!!!! I am almost in tears listening to this music.",
